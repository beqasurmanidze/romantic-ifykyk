        Hey, I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate having you in
        my life. You make everything easier and better, and I feel really lucky
        to know you. At the same time, I have to admit that I’m a bit scared. I
        can’t imagine losing you, and the thought of it worries me. You mean a
        lot to me, I just wanted to make sure you know how much I value you.
